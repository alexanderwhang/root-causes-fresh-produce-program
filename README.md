# Root Causes: Fresh Produce Program

The Fresh Produce Program (FPP) is an initiative founded by the Root Causes student group of Dukeâ€™s School of Medicine. 
Through strategic partnerships with Duke and Durham organizations, the program aims to address food insecurity for 
low-income Duke patients with chronic diseases by providing access to healthy food options. Currently, FPP supports over 
380 patients through biweekly deliveries of fresh produce and nutritional education material to their homes.

Our team developed a platform that:
- tracks program participants and volunteers
- receives and sends SMS texts to participants via Twilio
- assigns callers to participants based on language spoken
- utilizes a routing app to assign fastest routes for food delivieries
