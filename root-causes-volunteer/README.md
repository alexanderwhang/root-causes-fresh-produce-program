# Root Causes Volunteer App Front-End

Front-end React code for the volunteer application. 

<!-- ## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information. -->

## Description
<!-- Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors. -->
The following are the two main folders in this project for the volunteer app.

### react-volunteer-app
This folder contains all of the React app code. You'll have to cd into this folder to run npm start.

### stylesheets
This folder contains all of the CSS styling sheets used throughout the app.

## Structure
The following are folders inside of the ``` src ``` folder.

### components
Within this folder are folders for each of the pages. Inside of these, you'll find all of the components used on each page.

### pages
These are the main JS files for each page. This is where we added calls to our important components (ex. CustomizedTable, which basically contains all of the code for the page).

### images-react
When you upload an image on the Routes page, this is where it'll upload to.

### styleSheets
CSS files for the different pages and components.

## Installation
<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->
Make sure you node modules are installed before running your React pages.

```
npm install react-scripts

```

## Roadmap
In the future, we'd like to see our React following all conventions and more features added.

## Project status
When your run the pages, all of the React is functioning. Development of new code will be picked up by a new team in the future.

<!-- If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers. -->
